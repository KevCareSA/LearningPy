# What Are Dictionaries?

A dictionary is a collection of unordered data, which is stored in key-value pairs. What
is meant by “unordered” is the way it is stored in memory. It is not accessible through
an index, rather it is accessed through a key.

All dictionaries are created by using open and closed curly brackets.

In between the curly brackets, we define our key-value pairs.

Keys can be declared with ONLY strings or numbers.

There’s a colon that separates the key and value.

After the colon is the value, and this can be any data type including other data
collections or even another dictionary:

More than one key value pair in the dictionary:

Another Example:

```python
 # declaring a dictionary variable
empty = { } # empty dictionary
person = { "name": "John Smith" }
# dictionary with one key/value pair
customer = {
"name": "Morty",
"age": 26
} # dictionary with two key/value pairs
print(customer)
```

## Accessing Dictionary Information

All data stored within a dictionary is accessed via the key associated with the value
you’re trying to access. We simply write the name of the dictionary followed by square
brackets. Inside of the square brackets is the key. This will retrieve the value stored at
that key:

```python
#accessing dictionary information through keys
person = { "name": 'John" }
print( person[ "name" ] ) # access information through the key
```

## Looping a Dictionary

Dictionaries are iterable like lists. However, they have three different methods for doing
so. You can iterate over both the keys and values together, only keys, or only values.

### Looping Only Keys

To iterate through a dictionary while only accessing the keys, you’ll use the .keys() method:

```python
# looping over a dictionary via the keys
person = { "name": "John", "age": 26 }
for key in person.keys( ):
print(key)
print( person[key] ) # will output the value at the current key
```

### Looping Only Values

When you don’t need to access the keys, using the .values( ) method is best:

```python
# looping over a dictionary via the values

person = { "name": "John", "age": 26 }
for value in person.values( ):
print(value)
```

### Looping Key-Value Pairs

If you need the ability to access both the key and value, then you’ll want to use the
.items() method. This approach will assign two temporary variables instead of one:

```python
# looping over a dictionary via the key/value pair
person = { "name": "John", "age": 26 }
for key, value in person.items( ):
print( f"{key}: {value}.")
```

## Dictionaries with Lists

```python
# storing a list within a dictionary and accessing it
data = { "sports": [ "baseball", "football", "hockey", "soccer" ] }
print( data["sports"][0] ) # first access the key, then the index
```

we cannot create a dictionary that stores a list without first
attaching a key:

```python
# improperly storing a list within a dictionary
sports = [ "baseball", "football", "hockey", "soccer" ]
sports_dict = dict( sports ) # will produce error, no key
```

## Lists with Dictionaries

When a list is storing a dictionary, you need to access that dictionary by the index first.

After that you have access to the key-value pairs within the dictionary.

```python
# storing a dictionary within a list and accessing it
data = [ "John", "Dennis", { "name": "Kirsten" } ]
print( data[2] ) # the dictionary is in index 2
print( data[2]["name"] ) # first access the index, then access the key
```

## Dictionaries with Dictionaries

Dictionaries are very powerful and efficient due to how they’re stored in memory. Often,
you’ll want to use dictionaries as the value for your key-value pairs.

```python
#Nesting Dictionary in a Dictionary
travel_log = {
"France": {
"cities_visited" : ["Paris","Lille", "Dijon'"], 
"total_visits": 12
},
"Germany": {
"cities_visited'" : [" Berlin" , "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"] , 
"total_visits" : 5
},

```

```python
# storing a dictionary within a dictionary and accessing it
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}

print(myfamily["child2"]["name"]) #first access the child2 key, then the name key
```

## Dictionary Methods

Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [clear()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_clear.asp) | Removes all the elements from the dictionary |
| [copy()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_copy.asp) | Returns a copy of the dictionary |
| [fromkeys()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_fromkeys.asp) | Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value |
| [get()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_get.asp) | Returns the value of the specified key |
| [items()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_items.asp) | Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair |
| [keys()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_keys.asp) | Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys |
| [pop()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_pop.asp) | Removes the element with the specified key |
| [popitem()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_popitem.asp) | Removes the last inserted key-value pair |
| [setdefault()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_setdefault.asp) | Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist: insert the key, with the specified value |
| [update()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_update.asp) | Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs |
| [values()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_values.asp) | Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary |
