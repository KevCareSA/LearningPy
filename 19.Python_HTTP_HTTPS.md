# HTTP Terms and HTTP Tools

## Structure of a Request

If we say a client and a server are having a conversation, the two halves of the conversation are a request and a response.

Using an HTTP request, a client is requesting (asking) something from a server.

### Every request requires some information to work

**Method**: The method tells the server what the client wants it to do.
**URL**: The URL tells the HTTP tool where to send the request.
**Protocol**: Set by the HTTP tool used.
**Headers**: Headers give the server more information about the request itself.

### HTTP Methods

HTTP stands for - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

- HTTP is simply a way of communication between a client and server
- HTTP works as a way of requesting and responding between a client and server.
- In HTTP, there are two different roles: server and client. In general, the client always initiates the conversation; the server replies.

Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains information about the request and may also have the requested content.

**HTTP Methods**:
-GET
-POST
-PUT
-HEAD
-DELETE
-PATCH
-OPTIONS
-CONNECT
-TRACE

The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST.

### The **GET** Method

- **GET** is used to request data (ask for information) from a specified resource.

Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request:
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2

Let's add examples to illustrate the concepts:

1. **Used to retrieve data from a specified resource:**
    - Example: `GET /api/user/123`
        - In this example, a GET request is made to retrieve information about the user with the ID 123 from an API.
2. **Parameters are appended to the URL:**
    - Example: `GET /search?q=example&category=web`
        - Here, a GET request is made to a search endpoint with parameters "q" (query) set to "example" and "category" set to "web."
3. **Commonly used for fetching web pages, images, documents, etc.:**
    - Example: `GET <https://example.com/page.html`>
        - This GET request fetches an HTML page from the specified URL.
4. **Idempotent and safe:**
    - Example of Idempotence: `GET /api/product/456`
        - Repeatedly making this GET request to retrieve product information for ID 456 will consistently return the same data without modifying any server state.
    - Example of Safety: `GET /api/temperature`
        - Fetching the current temperature does not modify any data on the server; it is a safe operation suitable for a GET request.

Lets make examples with more code for understanding:

Let's expand further on each scenario with more details and comments in the code:

### 1. Used to retrieve data from a specified resource

```python
import requests

# Define the URL for retrieving user information with ID 123
url = "<https://api.example.com/user/123>"

# Make a GET request to the specified URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Print the JSON data received from the server
print(response.json())

```

### Detailed Explanation

- We import the `requests` library to handle HTTP requests.
- The `url` variable holds the URL for retrieving information about the user with ID 123.
- The `requests.get(url)` initiates a GET request to the specified URL.
- The server responds with data, and `response.json()` extracts and prints the JSON data from the response.

---

### 2. Parameters are appended to the URL

```python
import requests

# Define the URL for a search endpoint
url = "<https://search.example.com/search>"

# Define parameters for the search query
params = {"q": "example", "category": "web"}

# Make a GET request with parameters appended to the URL
response = requests.get(url, params=params)

# Print the JSON data received from the server
print(response.json())

```

### Detailed Explanation 1

- We define the `url` variable for a search endpoint.
- The `params` dictionary contains parameters like "q" (query) and "category."
- `requests.get(url, params=params)` adds the parameters to the URL and makes a GET request.
- The server responds with data, and `response.json()` extracts and prints the JSON data from the response.

---

### 3. Commonly used for fetching web pages, images, documents, etc

```python
import requests

# Define the URL for fetching an HTML page
url = "<https://example.com/page.html>"

# Make a GET request to the specified URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Print the HTML content received from the server
print(response.text)

```

### Detailed Explanation 2

- We define the `url` variable for fetching an HTML page.
- The `requests.get(url)` initiates a GET request to the specified URL.
- The server responds with HTML content, and `response.text` extracts and prints the content.

---

### 4. Idempotent and safe

### Example of Idempotence

```python
import requests

# Define the URL for retrieving product information with ID 456
url = "<https://api.example.com/product/456>"

# Make a GET request to the specified URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Print the JSON data received from the server
print(response.json())

```

### Detailed Explanation 3

- We define the `url` variable for retrieving product information with ID 456.
- The GET request to this URL is idempotent, meaning making the same request multiple times will consistently return the same data.
- The server responds with data, and `response.json()` extracts and prints the JSON data from the response.

---

### Example of Safety

```python
import requests

# Define the URL for fetching current temperature information
url = "<https://api.example.com/temperature>"

# Make a GET request to the specified URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Print the JSON data received from the server
print(response.json())

```

### Detailed Explanation 4

- We define the `url` variable for fetching current temperature information.
- The GET request to this URL is safe, as it doesn't modify any data on the server; it only retrieves information.
- The server responds with data, and `response.json()` extracts and prints the JSON data from the response.

These expanded examples provide more detailed comments and explanations for each code segment, making it clearer how each part of the code contributes to the overall functionality.

These examples demonstrate how the GET method is used to retrieve various types of data by appending parameters to the URL, and how it adheres to the principles of idempotence and safety.

Let's break down a full Python code example for making a `GET` request to retrieve information about a user with the ID 123 from an API. We'll use the `requests` library for making HTTP requests.

```python
import requests

# Define the API endpoint for retrieving user information
api_url = "<https://example-api.com/api/user/123>"

# Make a GET request to retrieve information about the user with ID 123
response = requests.get(api_url)

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse and print the JSON response containing user information
    user_data = response.json()
    print("User Information:")
    print(f"ID: {user_data['id']}")
    print(f"Name: {user_data['name']}")
    print(f"Email: {user_data['email']}")
else:
    # Print an error message if the request was not successful
    print(f"Failed to retrieve user information. Status Code: {response.status_code}")

```

**Breakdown:**

1. **Importing the `requests` library:**
    - `import requests`: This line imports the `requests` library, which is commonly used for making HTTP requests in Python.
2. **Defining the API endpoint:**
    - `api_url = "<https://example-api.com/api/user/123>"`: Here, we define the URL of the API endpoint for retrieving user information. In this example, it's assumed to be "[https://example-api.com/api/user/123."](https://example-api.com/api/user/123.%22)
3. **Making the GET request:**
    - `response = requests.get(api_url)`: This line sends a `GET` request to the specified API endpoint (`api_url`) and stores the response in the `response` variable.
4. **Checking the response status code:**
    - `if response.status_code == 200:`

    This conditional statement checks if the HTTP status code in the response is `200` (OK), indicating a successful request.
5. **Processing the successful response:**
    - `user_data = response.json()
    print("User Information:")
    print(f"ID: {user_data['id']}")
    print(f"Name: {user_data['name']}")
    print(f"Email: {user_data['email']}")`

    If the request is successful, the JSON response is parsed, and user information is printed to the console, including the user's ID, name, and email.
6. **Handling unsuccessful responses:**
    - `else: print(f"Failed to retrieve user information. Status Code: {response.status_code}")`

    If the request is not successful (status code other than 200), an error message is printed to the console, including the HTTP status code.

This code provides a comprehensive breakdown of how to make a `GET` request to retrieve user information from an API using the `requests` library in Python.

Some notes on GET requests:

- GET requests can be cached
- GET requests remain in the browser history
- GET requests can be bookmarked
- GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
- GET requests have length restrictions
- GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

---

### The POST Method

POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request:

POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: [w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com/)
name1=value1&name2=value2

Let's break down each example with detailed comments:

### The POST Method 2

The POST method is one of the HTTP methods used in web development. It is employed to send data to a server, typically to create or update a resource on the server. POST requests are commonly used when submitting forms on web pages, uploading files, or making requests that require sending data in the request body.

Key characteristics of the POST method:

1. **Data in the Request Body:**
    - Unlike the GET method, which appends data to the URL, POST sends data in the request body. This allows for the transmission of more substantial amounts of data.
2. **Creating or Updating Resources:**
    - POST is often used for operations that create new resources on the server or update existing ones. For example, submitting a form to create a new user account or uploading an image file.
3. **Idempotence:**
    - Unlike GET, POST requests are not considered idempotent. This means that making the same POST request multiple times may result in different outcomes on the server.
4. **Security Considerations:**
    - POST requests are more secure than GET requests for sensitive operations because data is not visible in the URL. However, HTTPS should still be used for secure transmission of data.

### Examples of POST Requests

### Example 1: Creating a User Account

```python
import requests

# Define the URL for creating a user account
url = "<https://api.example.com/create_user>"

# Data to be sent in the request body
data = {"username": "john_doe", "password": "secure123"}

# Make a POST request to create a user account
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

# Print the response status code and content
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response Content:", response.json())

```

### Breakdown

1. **Define URL and Data:**

    ```python
    # Define the URL for creating a user account
    url = "<https://api.example.com/create_user>"
    
    # Data to be sent in the request body
    data = {"username": "john_doe", "password": "secure123"}
    
    ```

    - We set the `url` variable to the endpoint where we want to create a user account.
    - The `data` dictionary contains the information we want to send in the request body.
2. **Make a POST Request:**

    ```python
    # Make a POST request to create a user account
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    
    ```

    - The `requests.post(url, json=data)` method is used to make a POST request to the specified URL.
    - The `json=data` argument specifies that we want to send the data in JSON format in the request body.
3. **Capture the Server's Response:**

    ```python
    # Print the response status code and content
    print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
    print("Response Content:", response.json())
    
    ```

    - `response` now holds the server's response to our POST request.
    - `response.status_code` gives us the HTTP status code, indicating the success or failure of our request.
    - `response.json()` extracts and prints the JSON data from the server's response.

### Example 2: Uploading a File

```python
import requests

# Define the URL for file upload
url = "<https://api.example.com/upload_file>"

# Open and read a file to be uploaded
with open("example_file.txt", "rb") as file:
    file_data = file.read()

# Make a POST request to upload the file
response = requests.post(url, data=file_data)

# Print the response status code and content
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response Content:", response.text)

```

### Breakdown 1

1. **Define URL and Read File:**

    ```python
    # Define the URL for file upload
    url = "<https://api.example.com/upload_file>"
    
    # Open and read a file to be uploaded
    with open("example_file.txt", "rb") as file:
        file_data = file.read()
    
    ```

    - We set the `url` variable to the endpoint where we want to upload a file.
    - We open and read the contents of a file (`example_file.txt`) to be uploaded.
2. **Make a POST Request:**

    ```python
    # Make a POST request to upload the file
    response = requests.post(url, data=file_data)
    
    ```

    - The `requests.post(url, data=file_data)` method is used to make a POST request to the specified URL.
    - The `data=file_data` argument specifies that we want to send the file data in the request body.
3. **Capture the Server's Response:**

    ```python
    # Print the response status code and content
    print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
    print("Response Content:", response.text)
    
    ```

    - `response` now holds the server's response to our POST request.
    - `response.status_code` gives us the HTTP status code, indicating the success or failure of our request.
    - `response.text` extracts and prints the content from the server's response.

---

In summary, these breakdowns provide detailed comments explaining each part of the POST request examples, helping to understand how data is sent to a server using the POST method.

Some notes on POST requests:

- POST requests are never cached
- POST requests do not remain in the browser history
- POST requests cannot be bookmarked
- POST requests have no restrictions on data length

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows two applications, like a client and a server, to talk to each other.
If the server is the whole restaurant, the API is the waiter, the menu is the list of methods the API provides,
and the hungry customer is the client.

Let's consider a different example where we make a PUT request to update the status of an order with ID 456 in an e-commerce API:

```python
import requests

# Define the URL for updating order status with ID 456
url = "<https://api.example.com/update_order_status/456>"

# Data to be sent in the request body for the update
update_data = {"status": "shipped", "tracking_number": "XYZ123"}

# Make a PUT request with data in the request body for the update
response = requests.put(url, json=update_data)

# Print the response status code and content
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response Content:", response.json())

```

### Breakdown 2

1. **Define URL and Data:**

    ```python
    # Define the URL for updating order status with ID 456
    url = "<https://api.example.com/update_order_status/456>"
    
    # Data to be sent in the request body for the update
    update_data = {"status": "shipped", "tracking_number": "XYZ123"}
    
    ```

    - We set the `url` variable to the endpoint where we want to update the order status with ID 456.
    - The `update_data` dictionary contains the information we want to send in the request body for the update, such as the new status and tracking number.
2. **Make a PUT Request:**

    ```python
    # Make a PUT request with data in the request body for the update
    response = requests.put(url, json=update_data)
    
    ```

    - The `requests.put(url, json=update_data)` method is used to make a PUT request to the specified URL.
    - The `json=update_data` argument specifies that we want to send the data in JSON format in the request body for the update.
3. **Capture the Server's Response:**

    ```python
    # Print the response status code and content
    print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
    print("Response Content:", response.json())
    
    ```

    - `response` now holds the server's response to our PUT request.
    - `response.status_code` gives us the HTTP status code, indicating the success or failure of our request.
    - `response.json()` extracts and prints the JSON data from the server's response.

This example illustrates how to use the PUT method to update the status of an order in an e-commerce system. The process involves defining the URL, preparing the data for the update, making the PUT request, and capturing and printing the server's response.

    print(response.json())
    
    ```

**Code Explanation:**

1. **Importing the 'requests' module:**
    - `import requests`: This line imports the 'requests' module, allowing the script to use functions for making HTTP requests.
2. **Making a GET request:**
    - `response = requests.get("<https://api.library.com/books/123>")`: This line sends a GET request to the specified URL ("<https://api.library.com/books/123>").
        - `requests.get()`: Initiates a GET request to the provided URL.
        - `<https://api.library.com/books/123>`: Placeholder URL; replace it with the actual API endpoint URL.

    ```

- **Explanation:** DELETE is used to request the removal of a resource. This example deletes the book with ID 123 from the library.

### 6. **HEAD: Retrieving Only Headers**

- **Purpose:** Retrieve only the headers (metadata) of a resource.
- **Example:**

    ```python
    import requests
    
    # Making a HEAD request to get only the headers of a book with ID 123
    response = requests.head("<https://api.library.com/books/123>")
    
    # Printing the headers received from the server
    print(response.headers)
    
    ```

- **Code Explanation:**

1. **Importing the 'requests' module:**
    - `import requests`: This line imports the 'requests' module, allowing the script to use functions for making HTTP requests.
2. **Making a HEAD request to retrieve only the headers:**
    - `response = requests.head("<https://api.library.com/books/123>")`: This line sends a HEAD request to the specified URL ("<https://api.library.com/books/123>") to retrieve only the headers (metadata) of a book with ID 123.
        - `requests.head()`: Initiates a HEAD request to the provided URL.
        - `<https://api.library.com/books/123>`: Placeholder URL; replace it with the actual API endpoint URL and the specific book ID.
        - The server's response (headers only) is stored in the variable `response`.
3. **Printing the headers received from the server:**
    - `print(response.headers)`: This line prints the headers received from the server in response to the HEAD request.
        - `response`: Contains the server's response obtained from the HEAD request.
        - `.headers`: Retrieves the headers from the response.
        - `print()`: Outputs the headers to the console.

This code snippet is useful when you only need information about the resource's headers without downloading the entire content. Make sure to replace `"<https://api.library.com/books/123>"` with the correct URL of the API endpoint and the specific resource (book) ID.

### 7. **OPTIONS: Retrieving Communication Options**

- **Purpose:** Get information about the communication options for a resource.
- **Example:**

    ```python
    import requests
    
    # Making an OPTIONS request to get communication options for the books resource
    response = requests.options("<https://api.library.com/books>")
    
    # Printing the headers received from the server
    print(response.headers)
    
    ```

- **Explanation:** OPTIONS is used to query the server about available communication options. In this example, it fetches information about allowed methods and headers for the books resource.

### 8. **TRACE: Echoing Back the Request**

- **Purpose:** Echo back the received request for diagnostic purposes.
- **Example:**

    ```python
    import requests
    
    # Making a TRACE request to echo back the received request for diagnostic purposes
    response = requests.request("TRACE", "<https://api.library.com/path/resource>")
    
    # Printing the response text, which should reflect the echoed request
    print(response.text)
    
    ```

- **Explanation:** TRACE is used for diagnostic purposes, echoing back the received request. In this example, it prints the response text, reflecting the original request.

### 9. **CONNECT: Establishing a Network Connection**

- **Purpose:** Establish a network connection to a resource (typically used in the context of a proxy).
- **Example:**
  - Python's `requests` library doesn't directly support CONNECT, as it's typically used for proxy communication and establishing secure connections.

These detailed explanations aim to provide a clearer understanding of each HTTP method, its purpose, and how to implement it using the `requests` library in Python.
