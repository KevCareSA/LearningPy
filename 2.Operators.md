# Basic Python Operators**

## **1. Arithmetic Operators**

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations. They are the foundation of most calculations in Python.

**Step 1: Understand Basic Arithmetic Operators**

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers.
    
    ```python
    result = 5 + 3  # result is 8
    
    ```
    
- **Subtraction (``)**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
    
    ```python
    result = 10 - 2  # result is 8
    
    ```
    
- **Multiplication (``)**: Multiplies two numbers.
    
    ```python
    result = 4 * 7  # result is 28
    
    ```
    
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first number by the second (results in a float).
    
    ```python
    result = 20 / 4  # result is 5.0
    
    ```
    
- **Floor Division (`//`)**: Divides the first number by the second and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.
    
    ```python
    result = 15 // 4  # result is 3
    
    ```
    
- **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of the division of the first number by the second.
    
    ```python
    remainder = 10 % 3  # remainder is 1
    
    ```
    
- **Exponentiation (`*`)**: Raises the first number to the power of the second.
    
    ```python
    result = 2 ** 3  # result is 8
    
    ```
    

**Step 2: Apply Each Operator**

- Practice using these operators with different numbers to see how they work in various scenarios. For example, combine them in complex expressions:
    
    ```python
    total = (5 + 2) * (10 - 3) / 7  # total is 7.0
    
    ```
    
- Keep in mind the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when combining multiple operators in an expression.

### **2. Comparison Operators**

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean (`True` or `False`).

**Step 1: Learn the Comparison Operators**

- **Equal (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.
    
    ```python
    is_equal = (5 == 5)  # is_equal is True
    
    ```
    
- **Not Equal (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.
    
    ```python
    is_not_equal = (5 != 3)  # is_not_equal is True
    
    ```
    
- **Greater Than (`>`)**: Checks if the first value is greater than the second.
    
    ```python
    is_greater = (10 > 5)  # is_greater is True
    
    ```
    
- **Less Than (`<`)**: Checks if the first value is less than the second.
    
    ```python
    is_less = (2 < 5)  # is_less is True
    
    ```
    
- **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**: Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second.
    
    ```python
    is_greater_or_equal = (7 >= 7)  # is_greater_or_equal is True
    
    ```
    
- **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**: Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.
    
    ```python
    is_less_or_equal = (3 <= 5)  # is_less_or_equal is True
    
    ```
    

**Step 2: Use in Conditional Statements**

- Implement these operators in `if-else` statements to make decisions based on comparisons:
    
    ```python
    age = 18
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are an adult.")
    else:
        print("You are a minor.")
    
    ```
    

### **3. Logical Operators**

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements, making it possible to test multiple conditions at once.

**Step 1: Learn the Logical Operators**

- **And (`and`)**: Returns `True` if both statements are true.
    
    ```python
    is_adult_and_registered = (age >= 18) and (registered == True)
    
    ```
    
- **Or (`or`)**: Returns `True` if at least one statement is true.
    
    ```python
    can_enter_club = (age >= 21) or (has_permission == True)
    
    ```
    
- **Not (`not`)**: Reverses the result, returning `False` if the result is true.
    
    ```python
    is_not_minor = not(age < 18)
    
    ```
    

**Step 2: Combine Conditions**

- Combine multiple conditions in an `if` statement using logical operators:
    
    ```python
    age = 20
    registered = True
    
    if age >= 18 and registered:
        print("You can vote.")
    
    ```
    
- Understand short-circuit evaluation, where Python stops evaluating as soon as the outcome is determined. For example, in `and` conditions, if the first condition is `False`, Python doesn't check the second one.

### **4. Assignment Operators**

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables and can also perform operations while doing so.

**Step 1: Learn Basic Assignment Operators**

- **Assignment (`=`)**: Assigns the right-side value to the left-side variable.
    
    ```python
    x = 5  # x is 5
    
    ```
    
- **Add and Assign (`+=`)**: Adds the right-side value to the left-side variable and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
    
    ```python
    x += 3  # x is now 8
    
    ```
    
- **Subtract and Assign (`=`)**: Subtracts the right-side value from the left-side variable and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
    
    ```python
    x -= 2  # x is now 6
    
    ```
    
- **Multiply and Assign (`=`)**: Multiplies the left-side variable by the right-side value and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
    
    ```python
    x *= 2  # x is now 12
    
    ```
    
- **Divide and Assign (`/=`)**: Divides the left-side variable by the right-side value and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
    
    ```python
    x /= 3  # x is now 4.0
    
    ```
    
- **Modulus and Assign (`%=`)**: Takes the modulus of the left-side variable by the right-side value and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
    
    ```python
    x %= 2  # x is now 0.0
    
    ```
    
- **Exponentiate and Assign (`*=`)**: Raises the left-side variable to the power of the right-side value and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
    
    ```python
    x **= 3  # x is now 0.0
    
    ```
    
- **Floor Divide and Assign (`//=`)**: Floor divides the left-side variable by the right-side value and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
    
    ```python
    x //= 2  # x is now 0.0
    
    ```
    

**Step 2: Practice Assigning Values**

- Use these operators to modify variable values in various arithmetic operations. For example:
    
    ```python
    balance = 1000
    balance += 500  # balance is now 1500
    balance -= 200  # balance is now 1300
    
    ```
    

### **5. Bitwise Operators**

Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representation of numbers.

**Step 1: Understand Bitwise Operators**

- **AND (`&`)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation.
    
    ```python
    result = 5 & 3  # result is 1 (binary: 101 & 011 = 001)
    
    ```
    
- **OR (`|`)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation.
    
    ```python
    result = 5 | 3  # result is 7 (binary: 101 | 011 = 111)
    
    ```
    
- **XOR (`^`)**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation.
    
    ```python
    result = 5 ^ 3  # result is 6 (binary: 101 ^ 011 = 110)
    
    ```
    
- **NOT (`~`)**: Performs a bitwise NOT operation.
    
    ```python
    result = ~5  # result is -6 (inverts the bits)
    
    ```
    
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits of the first operand left by the number of positions specified by the second operand.
    
    ```python
    result = 5 << 1  # result is 10 (binary: 101 becomes 1010)
    
    ```
    
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts the bits of the first operand right by the number of positions specified by the second operand.
    
    ```python
    result = 5 >> 1  # result is 2 (binary: 101 becomes 010)
    
    ```
    

**Step 2: Apply Bitwise Operations**

- Convert numbers to binary format and practice applying these operators:
    
    ```python
    a = 0b1010
    b = 0b0101
    result = a & b  # result is 0b0000
    
    ```
    

### **6. Identity Operators**

Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects, not just their values.

**Step 1: Learn Identity Operators**

- **Is (`is`)**: Returns `True` if both variables point to the same object in memory.
    
    ```python
    x = [1, 2
    
    ```
    

, 3]
y = x
z = [1, 2, 3]
result = (x is y)  # result is True
result = (x is z)  # result is False

```
- **Is Not (`is not`)**: Returns `True` if the variables point to different objects in memory.
```python
result = (x is not z)  # result is True

```

**Step 2: Compare Objects**

- Test identity operators by comparing variables that point to the same or different objects. Understand that even if two objects have the same content, they might occupy different memory locations.

### **7. Membership Operators**

Membership operators test for the presence of a value in a sequence like strings, lists, or tuples.

**Step 1: Understand Membership Operators**

- **In (`in`)**: Returns `True` if the specified value is found in the sequence.
    
    ```python
    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    result = (3 in nums)  # result is True
    
    ```
    
- **Not In (`not in`)**: Returns `True` if the specified value is not found in the sequence.
    
    ```python
    result = (5 not in nums)  # result is True
    
    ```
    

**Step 2: Check Membership in Sequences**

- Practice using membership operators with lists, tuples, and strings:
    
    ```python
    word = "hello"
    result = ('e' in word)  # result is True
    
    ```
