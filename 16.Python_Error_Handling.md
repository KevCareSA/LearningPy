# How to Handle Errors in Python – the try, except, else, and finally Keywords Explained

Errors are inevitable in a programmer's life. In fact, while writing programs, errors can be really helpful in identifying the logic bugs and syntax errors in your code.

But, if you can anticipate an error in a particular set of code lines before execution, then you can handle those errors and make the code error free.

## **Why Error Handling is Important**

Handling or taking care of errors that you're aware of helps the code flow and execute smoothly without any interruptions. If errors occur in any lines of code, the error handling takes care of them and then the code resumes execution.

Let's take an example and understand why we need error handling:

```python
# Assign values to variables
a = 12
b = 6

# Perform division
result = a / b

# Print the result
print(result)

# Print a message
print("I have reached the end of the line")
```

From the above code, what do you expect ?.

Well, the `result` variable prints `2.0` and on the next line,

the console prints `I have reached the end of the line`.

That's what we are excepting.

Let's change value of `b` from `b = 6` to `b = 0` and run.

```python
a = 12
b = 0

result = a / b

print(result)
print("I have reached the end of the line")
```

When this code gets executed, we will get an error as below:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "error_handle.py", line 3, in <module>
    result = a / b
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

Error message displayed when b is set to 0

The code didn't print the `result` value and

it also didn't print `I have reached the end of the line`

The above error messages displays `division by zero`,

which means that if we try to divide any number by `0`, we will get this error.

The problem is in line `3`.

Even though the code didn't print the `result` value,

 it should have printed `I have reached the end of the line`.

But, it didn't – why ?

Well, because the Python interpreter stopped at line 3 when the `a` got divided by `0`.

At this point, it raised an error in the console and exited the code.

Another major problem that may arise is when a user wants to give values of `a` and `b` at the time of execution.

```python
# Get user input for variables
a = int(input("Enter the value of a: "))
b = int(input("Enter the value of b: "))

# Perform division and store the result in 'result'
result = a / b

# Print the result of the division
print(result)

# Print a message indicating the end of the program
print("I have reached the end of the line")
```

At this time, there's a high probability that the user will give `0` as the input to `b`.

In order to handle this kind of expected error, we will use certain methods of

error handling in order to avoid interrupting the execution flow

(even though the user might give any invalid input like `0` as input to `b`).

# **How to Use the Try and Except Keywords in Python**

Any lines of code that are more prone to errors are kept in `try` block.

If any error occurs, then the `except` block will take care of those errors.

The code structure looks something like this:
``Code Structure of try/except keywords

```python
try:
   code that may/may not produce errors
except:
   when an error arises, then this block of code executes.
   Otherwise, this block of code doesn't execute
```

We will handle the `division by zero` problem using `try/except` blocks.

Let's insert the lines of code that have a high probability of producing an error.

In our case, lines `1-4` of our code have high potential to produce an error.

So, we put these four lines in the `try` block:

```python
 # Try to get user input and perform division
try:
    a = int(input("Enter the value of a: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the value of b: "))
    result = a / b
    print("Result of division:", result)

except:
    # Execute this block if any error arises
    print("We caught an error")

# Regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, this line will be executed
print("I have reached the end of the line")
```

                             Try and Except block to divisible problem

Now, when we give `b` a value of `0`, an error occurs.

So, the `except` block executes and the interpreter prints `We caught an error` and

comes out of the except block and resumes printing `I have reached the end of the line`.

On the other hand, when we give `b` a non-zero value, then we print the `result` value.

The code comes out of the try block and resumes printing `I have reached the end of the line`.

In both cases, we are able to execute until the last line of code without any interruptions.

Apart from try and except, it's quite important to understand

the `else` and `finally` keywords that come along with `try` and `except`.

The `else` block of code comes after the `try` and `except` blocks

 and executes when no error is raised from the `try` code block.

Similarly, the `finally` code block comes after the `else` block and executes

whether errors occur or not – this block will execute for sure.

Now that you understand how the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` code blocks work, the order of flow will be:

```python
try:
   code that may/may not produce errors

except:
   when an error arises, then this block of code executes

else:
   when an error doesn't arise, then this block of code executes

finally:
   This block will execute whether an error occurs or not.
```

Code Structure of Error Handling keyword Blocks

On applying the same structure to the number division problem, we get this:

```python
try:
    # Try to get user input and perform division
    a = int(input("Enter the value of a: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the value of b: "))
    result = a / b
    print("Result of division:", result)

except:
    # Execute this block if any error arises
    print("We caught an error")

else:
    # Execute this block if no exception occurs in the try block
    print("Hurray, we don't have any errors")

finally:
    # This block will execute whether an error occurs or not
    print("I have reached the end of the line")
```

Code Structure of number division problem after Error Handling keyword blocks

When `b` is assigned `0`, then we get an error. So, the except block executes and prints `We caught an Error` and finally the code block executes and prints `I have reached the end of the line`

Output for different scenarios:

Scenario 1 (Normal input, no errors):

```python
Enter the value of a: 10
Enter the value of b: 2
Result of division: 5.0
Hurray, we don't have any errors
I have reached the end of the line
```

Scenario 2 (Error occurs during division, e.g., division by zero):

```python
Enter the value of a: 8
Enter the value of b: 0
We caught an error
I have reached the end of the line
```

In Scenario 1, where there are no errors, both the **`else`** and **`finally`** blocks are executed. In Scenario 2, where an error occurs during division, the **`except`** and **`finally`** blocks are executed.++

# **Raising Exceptions in Python: The raise Statement**

In Python, you can raise either [built-in or custom](https://realpython.com/python-raise-exception/#choosing-the-exception-to-raise-built-in-vs-custom) exceptions.

When you raise an exception, the result is the same as when Python does it.

You get an exception traceback, and your program crashes unless you handle the exception on time.

To raise an exception by yourself, you’ll use the [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) statement, which has the following general syntax:

Python

`raise [expression [from another_expression]]`

A `raise` keyword with no argument reraises the active exception.

Note that you can only use a bare `raise` in `except` code blocks with an active exception. Otherwise, you’ll get a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError) exception:

```python
>>>>raise
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
RuntimeError: No active exception to reraise
```

In this example, you’re in a context with no active exceptions.

Therefore, Python can’t reraise a previous exception. Instead, it raises a `RuntimeError` exception.

The bare `raise` statement is useful when you need to perform some actions after catching an exception, and then you want to reraise the original exception. You’ll learn more about this use case of `raise` in the section [Reraising a Previous Exception](https://realpython.com/python-raise-exception/#reraising-a-previous-exception).

## **Choosing the Exception to Raise: Built-in vs Custom**

When it comes to manually raising exceptions in your code, deciding which exception to raise is an important step. In general, you should raise exceptions that clearly communicate the problem you’re dealing with. In Python, you can raise two different kinds of exceptions:

- **Built-in exceptions**: These exceptions are built into Python. You can use them directly in your code without importing anything.
- **User-defined exceptions**: Custom exceptions are those that you create when no built-in exception fits your needs. You’ll typically put them in a dedicated module for a specific project.

In the following sections, you’ll find some guidelines for deciding which exception to raise in your code.

### **Raising Built-in Exceptions**

Python has a rich set of built-in exceptions structured in a class [hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy) with the `BaseException` class at the top. One of the most frequently used subclasses of `BaseException` is `Exception`.

The `Exception` class is a fundamental part of Python’s exception-handling scaffolding. It’s the base class for most of the built-in exceptions that you’ll find in Python. It’s also the class that you’ll typically use to create your custom exceptions.

Python has more than sixty [built-in exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#built-in-exceptions). You’ve probably seen some of the following concrete exceptions in your day-to-day coding:

| Exception Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError) | Appears when an [`import`](https://realpython.com/python-import/) statement has trouble loading a module |
| [`ModuleNotFoundError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError) | Happens when `import` can’t locate a given module |
| [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError) | Appears when a [global](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/#modules-the-global-scope) or [local](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/#functions-the-local-scope) name isn’t defined |
| [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError) | Happens when an [attribute reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#attribute-references) or assignment fails |
| [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError) | Occurs when an indexing operation on a sequence uses an out-of-range index |
| [`KeyError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError) | Occurs when a key is missing in a [dictionary](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/) |
| [`ZeroDivisionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError) | Appears when the second operand in a division or [modulo](https://realpython.com/python-modulo-operator/) operation is `0` |
| [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError) | Happens when an operation, function, or method operates on an object of inappropriate type |
| [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) | Occurs when an operation, function, or method receives the right type of argument but the wrong value |

This table is just a small sample of Python’s built-in exceptions. You can use these and all the other built-in exceptions when using the `raise` statement in your code.

In most cases, you’ll likely find an appropriate built-in exception for your specific use case. If that’s your case, then favor the built-in exception over a custom one. For example, say you’re coding a function to compute the square of all the values in an input `list`, and you want to ensure that the input object is a list or tuple:

```python
def squared(numbers):
    if not isinstance(numbers, list | tuple):
        raise TypeError(
            f"list or tuple expected, got '{type(numbers).__name__}'"
        )
    return [number**2 for number in numbers]

squared([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

squared({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
File "<stdin>", line 3, in squared
TypeError: list or tuple expected, got 'set'
```

In `squared()`, you use a [conditional](https://realpython.com/python-conditional-statements/) statement to check whether the input object is a list or a tuple. If it’s not, then you raise a `TypeError` exception. That’s an excellent exception choice because you want to ensure the correct *type* in the input. If the type is wrong, then getting a `TypeError` is a logical response.
