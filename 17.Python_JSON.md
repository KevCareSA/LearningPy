# Python JSON

**JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a file that is mainly used to store and transfer data mostly between a server and a web application. It is popularly used for representing structured data.

We will discuss how to handle JSON data using Python.

Python provides a module called **json** which comes with Python’s standard built-in utility.

**Note:** In Python, JSON data is usually represented as a string.

Lets look at JSON:
example:

```python
{
    // Information about Jane
    "firstName": "Jane",  // Jane's first name
    "lastName": "Doe",    // Jane's last name

    // Jane's hobbies, stored in an array
    "hobbies": ["running", "sky diving", "singing"],

    // Jane's age, represented as a number
    "age": 35,

    // Information about Jane's children, stored in an array
    "children": [
        {
            // Information about Jane's first child
            "firstName": "Alice",  // Child's first name
            "age": 6               // Child's age
        },
        {
            // Information about Jane's second child
            "firstName": "Bob",    // Child's first name
            "age": 8               // Child's age
        }
    ]
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Objects:** The data is structured as key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
For example, `"firstName": "Jane"` represents a key-value pair where the key is "firstName," and the value is "Jane."
2. **Arrays:** The "hobbies" key has an associated value that is an array
`["running", "sky diving", "singing"]`.
Arrays are ordered lists enclosed in square brackets `[]`.

3. **Nested Objects:** The "children" key has an associated value that is an array of objects. Each object within the array represents a child with their respective attributes (e.g., "firstName" and "age").

This JSON structure provides a clear and organized way to represent complex data. It can be easily parsed by programming languages, making it a versatile format for data exchange and storage.

## Importing Module

To use any module in Python it is always needed to import that module.

We can import json module by using the [**import**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/import-module-python/) statement.

**Example:** Importing JSON module:

```python
# importing json module
import json
```

## **Serialization And Deserialization**

Serialization in JSON involves converting a complex data structure, into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

Notes: **Parse JSON - Convert from JSON to Python
-**If you have a JSON string, you can parse it by using the `json.loads()` method. It will become python object
-If you have a Python object, you can convert it into a JSON string by using the `json.dumps()` method.

Let's break down the process of serialization in JSON for beginners:

1. **Basic Data Structure:**
Assume you have a simple data structure in your programming code, like an object or a dictionary. For example:

```python
    person = {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 25,
        "city": "Exampletown"
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Serialization with JSON:**
    - **Definition:** Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object in your program into a JSON string.
    - **Example:**:
    
    ```python
    import json
    
    # Serialize the data structure to a JSON-formatted string
    json_string = json.dumps(person)
    
    print(json_string)
    
    ```
    
    The `dumps` function (which stands for "dump string") in the `json` module converts the Python object (`person` in this case) into a JSON-formatted string.
    
- **Example:** Suppose you have a Python object representing a person:
1. **Resulting JSON String:**
The resulting `json_string` would look like:
    
    ```json
    {"name": "John", "age": 25, "city": "Exampletown"}
    
    ```
    
    This is a serialized version of the original data structure in JSON format.
    
- **Definition:** Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object in your program into a JSON string.
    
    **Use Cases:**
    
    - **Storage:** You can save this JSON string to a file for later use or persistence.
    - **Transmission:** You can send this JSON string over a network, like in API communication.

1. **Deserialization:

Definition:** Deserialization is the process of converting a JSON string back into a data structure or object in your program.
If you later want to use this data back in your programming code, you can deserialize it. In Python:

```python
# Deserialize the JSON string back to a Python object
deserialized_person = json.loads(json_string)

print(deserialized_person)

```

This would give you a Python dictionary (`deserialized_person`) that you can work with as if you never serialized it.

- **`json.dumps(person)`** serializes the Python object **`person`** into a JSON-formatted string.
- **`json.loads(json_string)`** deserializes the JSON string back into a Python object.

## ANOTHER EXAMPLE

## Parsing JSON – Converting from JSON to Python

The [**load()**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-load-in-python/) and [**loads()**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-loads-in-python/) functions of the json module makes it easier to parse JSON object.

Parsing JSON String

The [**loads()**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-loads-in-python/) method is used to parse JSON strings in Python and the result will be a Python dictionary.

**Syntax:**

```python
json.loads(json_string)
```

**Example:** Converting JSON to a dictionary

```python
# Python program to convert JSON to Dict
import json

# JSON string
employee =
'{
"name": "Nitin", 
"department":"Finance", 
"company":"GFG"
}'

# Convert string to Python dict using loads()
employee_dict = json.loads(employee)

# Print the data after conversion
print("Data after conversion")
print(employee_dict)
print(employee_dict['department'])

# Print the type of data
print("\nType of data")
print(type(employee_dict))
```

---

**Output**:

```python
Data after conversion
{'name': 'Nitin', 'department': 'Finance', 'company': 'GFG'}
Finance

Type of data
<class 'dict'>
```

### Reading JSON file

[**load()**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-load-in-python/) method can read a file that contains a JSON object.

Suppose you have a file named student.json that contains student data and we want to read that file.

**Syntax:**

```python
json.load(file_object)
```

**Example:** Reading JSON file using Python

Let’s suppose the file looks like this.

```python
{
    "_id": 1,
    "name": "Vishwash",
    "Roll No": "1001",
    "Branch": "CSE"
  },
  {
    "_id": 2,
    "name": "Vishesh",
    "Roll No": "1002",
    "Branch": "IT"
  },
  {
    "_id": 3,
    "name": "Shivam",
    "Roll No": "1003",
    "Branch": "ME"
  },
  {
    "_id": 4,
    "name": "Yash",
    "Roll No": "1004",
    "Branch": "ECE"
  },
  {
    "_id": 5,
    "name": "Raju",
    "Roll No": "1005",
    "Branch": "CSE"
  }

# Python program to read JSON file

# Import the json module
import json

# Opening JSON file
# Here, 'data.json' is the name of the JSON file to be opened. Make sure the file is in the same directory as your Python script.
f = open('data.json',)

# returns JSON object as a dictionary
# The json.load() method is used to load the JSON data from the file into a Python dictionary.
data = json.load(f)

# Iterating through the json list
# The JSON data is stored as a list of dictionaries, so we iterate through the list to access each dictionary.
for item in data:
    # Printing each dictionary (which represents an individual record)
    print(item)

# Closing file
# It's important to close the file after reading to free up system resources.
f.close()
```

The output would look something like this:

```python
{'_id': 1, 'name': 'Vishwash', 'Roll No': '1001', 'Branch': 'CSE'}
{'_id': 2, 'name': 'Vishesh', 'Roll No': '1002', 'Branch': 'IT'}
{'_id': 3, 'name': 'Shivam', 'Roll No': '1003', 'Branch': 'ME'}
{'_id': 4, 'name': 'Yash', 'Roll No': '1004', 'Branch': 'ECE'}
{'_id': 5, 'name': 'Raju', 'Roll No': '1005', 'Branch': 'CSE'}
```

**Note:**

- JSON data is converted to a List of dictionaries in Python
- In the above example, we have used to open() and close() function for opening and closing JSON file.

## Convert from Python to JSON

[**dump()**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-dump-in-python/) and [**dumps()**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-dumps-in-python/) method of json module can be used to convert from Python object to JSON.

The following types of Python objects can be converted into JSON strings:

- dict
- list
- tuple
- string
- int
- float
- True
- False
- None

Python objects and their equivalent conversion to JSON:

| **Python** | **JSON Equivalent** |
| --- | --- |
| dict | object |
| list, tuple | array |
| str | string |
| int, float | number |
| True | true |
| False | false |
| None | null |

### Converting to JSON string

[**dumps()**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-dumps-in-python/) method can convert a Python object into a JSON string.

**Syntax:**

```python
json.dumps(dict, indent)
```

It takes two parameters:

- **dictionary:** name of dictionary which should be converted to JSON object.
- **indent:** defines the number of units for indentation

**Example:** Converting Python dictionary to JSON string

```python
# Python program to convert
# Python to JSON

import json

# Data to be written
dictionary = {
    "name": "sunil",
    "department": "HR",
    "Company": 'GFG'
}

# Serializing json
json_object = json.dumps(dictionary)
print(json_object)
```

Output:

```python
{"name": "sunil", "department": "HR", "Company": "GFG"}
```

### Writing to a JSON file

[**dump()**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-dump-in-python/) method can be used for writing to JSON file.

**Syntax:**

```python
json.dump(dict, file_pointer)
```

It takes 2 parameters:

- **dictionary:** name of a dictionary which should be converted to a JSON object.
- **file pointer:** pointer of the file opened in write or append mode.

**Example:** Writing to JSON File

```python
# Python program to write JSON to a file

import json

# Data to be written
dictionary = {
    "name": "Nisha",
    "rollno": 420,
    "cgpa": 10.10,
    "phonenumber": "1234567890"
}

# Writing JSON to a file
# The 'with' statement is used here to ensure that the file is properly closed
# even if an exception is raised during the execution of the 'with' block.
with open("sample.json", "w") as outfile:
    # json.dump() is used to write the contents of the dictionary to the file in JSON format.
    json.dump(dictionary, outfile)
```

Output:

```python
{"name": "Nisha", "rollno": 420, "cgpa": 10.1, "phonenumber": "1234567890"}
```

## Formatting JSON

In the above example, you must have seen that when you convert the Python object to JSON it does not get formatted and output comes in a straight line. We can format the JSON by passing the **indent** parameter to the dumps() method.

**Example:** Formatting JSON

```python
# Import required libraries
import json

# Initialize JSON data
json_data = '[ {"studentid": 1, "name": "Nikhil", "subjects": ["Python", "Data Structures"]},\
{"studentid": 2, "name": "Nisha", "subjects": ["Java", "C++", "R Lang"]} ]'

# Create Python object from JSON string 
# data
data = json.loads(json_data)

# Pretty Print JSON
json_formatted_str = json.dumps(data, indent=4)
print(json_formatted_str)
```

Here is the expected output:

```python
[
    {
        "studentid": 1,
        "name": "Nikhil",
        "subjects": [
            "Python",
            "Data Structures"
        ]
    },
    {
        "studentid": 2,
        "name": "Nisha",
        "subjects": [
            "Java",
            "C++",
            "R Lang"
        ]
    }
]
```
