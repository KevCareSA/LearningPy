# **Basic Variables and Data Types in Python**

## **1. Variables and Data Types in Python**

### **1.1. Introduction to Variables**

**What is a Variable?**

- A variable is a storage location in memory associated with a symbolic name (an identifier) which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. The variable name is the way to reference this stored data.

**How to Declare a Variable:**

- To declare a variable in Python, use the `=` operator, which is known as the assignment operator. The variable name is placed on the left, and the value is placed on the right.

**Syntax:**

```python
variable_name = value

```

**Example:**

```python
age = 25  # Here, 'age' is the variable name, and 25 is the integer value assigned to it.

```

- **Note:** In Python, variables do not need explicit declaration or type specification; the type is inferred from the assigned value.

### **1.2. Variable Naming Rules**

**Rules for Naming Variables:**

1. **Start with a Letter or Underscore:**
    - Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
    - **Valid Examples:**

        ```python
        name = "John"
        _name = "Jane"
        
        ```

    - **Invalid Example:**

        ```python
        2name = "Error"  # This will raise a syntax error because it starts with a number.
        
        ```

2. **Followed by Letters, Numbers, or Underscores:**
    - After the initial character, variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscores.
    - **Valid Examples:**

        ```python
        name1 = "John"
        name_1 = "Jane"
        
        ```

    - **Invalid Example:**

        ```python
        name-1 = "Error"  # This will raise a syntax error because it contains a hyphen.
        
        ```

3. **Case Sensitivity:**
    - Python is case-sensitive, meaning that `Age`, `age`, and `AGE` are considered different variables.
    - **Example:**

        ```python
        Age = 30
        age = 25
        
        ```

4. **No Reserved Keywords:**
    - Avoid using reserved words or keywords which are predefined by Python's syntax. Examples include `if`, `while`, `for`, `class`, etc.
    - **Invalid Example:**

        ```python
        if = 10  # This will raise a syntax error because 'if' is a reserved keyword.
        
        ```

### **1.3. Basic Data Types**

**Integers (`int`):**

- Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point. They can be positive or negative.
- **Examples:**

    ```python
    number = 10
    negative_number = -7
    
    ```

**Floating-Point Numbers (`float`):**

- Floating-point numbers are numbers that include a decimal point. They represent real numbers and can be positive or negative.
- **Examples:**

    ```python
    price = 99.99
    scientific_notation = 1.5e2  # 150.0 in scientific notation
    
    ```

**Strings (`str`):**

- Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). They can include letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Examples:**

    ```python
    message = "Hello, World!"
    another_message = 'Python is fun!'
    
    ```

**Booleans (`bool`):**

- Booleans represent one of two values: `True` or `False`. They are often used for conditional statements.
- **Examples:**

    ```python
    is_active = True
    is_finished = False
    
    ```

**Lists (`list`):**

- Lists are ordered collections of items that can be changed. Items are enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) and separated by commas.
- **Examples:**

    ```python
    colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
    mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
    
    ```

**Tuples (`tuple`):**

- Tuples are ordered collections of items similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned. Tuples are enclosed in parentheses (`()`).
- **Examples:**

    ```python
    coordinates = (10, 20)
    immutable_tuple = (1, "fixed", 3.14)
    
    ```

**Dictionaries (`dict`):**

- Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Keys are unique and are used to access the corresponding values. They are enclosed in curly braces (`{}`).
- **Examples:**

    ```python
    person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
    contact_info = {"email": "alice@example.com", "phone": "123-456-7890"}
    
    ```

### **1.4. Type Conversion**

**Implicit Conversion:**

- Python performs implicit type conversion (also known as type coercion) automatically when different types are involved in an operation.
- **Example:**

    ```python
    result = 5 + 2.0  # Integer 5 is automatically converted to float 5.0
    print(result)  # Output: 7.0
    
    ```

**Explicit Conversion:**

- Explicit conversion involves converting a value to a different type using built-in functions.
  - **To Integer:** `int(value)`
    - **Example:**

      ```python
            age = int(30.5)  # Converts 30.5 to 30 (floats are truncated)
            
      ```

  - **To Float:** `float(value)`
    - **Example:**

      ```python
            price = float("12.99")  # Converts the string "12.99" to the float 12.99
            
      ```

  - **To String:** `str(value)`
    - **Example:**

      ```python
            text = str(100)  # Converts integer 100 to the string "100"
            
      ```

### **1.5. Using Variables**

**Assignment:**

- Assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator.

    ```python
    x = 10
    y = 3.14
    
    ```

**Reassignment:**

- Update the value of an existing variable by reassigning it.

    ```python
    x = 10
    x = 20  # Now x is 20
    
    ```

**Multiple Assignment:**

- Assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.

    ```python
    a = b = c = 100  # a, b, and c all have the value 100
    
    ```

- Assign different values to multiple variables simultaneously.

    ```python
    x, y, z = 1, 2, 3  # x is 1, y is 2, z is 3
    
    ```

### **1.6. Checking Data Types**

**Checking the Data Type:**

- Use the `type()` function to determine the type of a variable.

    ```python
    number = 10
    print(type(number))  # Output: <class 'int'>
    
    text = "Hello"
    print(type(text))  # Output: <class 'str'>
    
    ```

- You can also use type checking in conditional statements.

    ```python
    if type(number) == int:
        print("number is an integer")
    
    ```
