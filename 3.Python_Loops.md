# Python Loops

## **1. Understanding the Basics of Loops**

Loops are a fundamental concept in programming, allowing you to execute a block of code multiple times. In Python, there are two primary types of loops:

- **`for` Loop**: Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).
- **`while` Loop**: Repeats as long as a specified condition is `True`.

### 

### **2. Writing a `for` Loop**

The `for` loop is used to iterate over elements of a sequence. Here's how to write a basic `for` loop:

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Start with the `for` keyword**.
2. **Specify the loop variable** that will take each value from the sequence.
3. **Use the `in` keyword** followed by the sequence (list, range, string, etc.).
4. **Write the block of code** to be executed on each iteration.

**Template:**

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute on each iteration
    pass  # Replace this with your code

```

In Python, the `for` loop is primarily used to iterate over sequences, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings. While there is only one type of `for` loop in Python, it can be used in various ways depending on the sequence or object you are iterating over. Here are the different types of `for` loops based on the sequences they iterate over:

### 1. **Looping Through a List**

A list is a collection of items, and you can iterate over each element in the list using a `for` loop.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

```

**Explanation:**

- The loop variable `fruit` takes on the value of each element in the `fruits` list, one at a time.
- The `print(fruit)` statement outputs each fruit in the list.

### 2. **Looping Through a Tuple**

A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable (cannot be changed). You can iterate over a tuple just like a list.

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

for color in colors:
    print(color)

```

**Explanation:**

- The loop variable `color` takes on the value of each element in the `colors` tuple, one at a time.
- The `print(color)` statement outputs each color in the tuple.

### 3. **Looping Through a Dictionary**

When iterating over a dictionary, you can loop through keys, values, or both keys and values.

- **Looping Through Keys:**

```python
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "grade": "A"}

for key in student:
    print(key)

```

**Explanation:**

- The loop variable `key` takes on the value of each key in the `student` dictionary.
- The `print(key)` statement outputs each key in the dictionary.
- **Looping Through Values:**

```python
for value in student.values():
    print(value)

```

**Explanation:**

- The loop variable `value` takes on the value of each value in the `student` dictionary.
- The `print(value)` statement outputs each value in the dictionary.
- **Looping Through Both Keys and Values:**

```python
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

```

**Explanation:**

- The loop variables `key` and `value` take on the corresponding key-value pairs from the `student` dictionary.
- The `print(f"{key}: {value}")` statement outputs each key and its corresponding value.

### 4. **Looping Through a Set**

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. You can iterate over a set just like a list or tuple.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

for number in unique_numbers:
    print(number)

```

**Explanation:**

- The loop variable `number` takes on the value of each element in the `unique_numbers` set, one at a time.
- The `print(number)` statement outputs each number in the set.

### 5. **Looping Through a String**

A string is a sequence of characters, and you can iterate over each character in the string.

```python
word = "Python"

for letter in word:
    print(letter)

```

**Explanation:**

- The loop variable `letter` takes on the value of each character in the string `word`, one at a time.
- The `print(letter)` statement outputs each character in the string.

### 6. **Looping Using `range()`**

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which is commonly used with `for` loops.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

```

**Explanation:**

- The loop variable `i` takes on each value generated by `range(5)`, starting from `0` up to `4`.
- The `print(i)` statement outputs each number in the range.

### 7. **Nested `for` Loops**

You can place one `for` loop inside another to create nested loops, which are useful for iterating over multi-dimensional sequences like lists of lists.

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

for row in matrix:
    for item in row:
        print(item, end=' ')
    print()

```

**Explanation:**

- The outer loop iterates over each `row` in the `matrix` (a list of lists).
- The inner loop iterates over each `item` in the current `row`.
- The `print(item, end=' ')` statement outputs each item in the row on the same line, and the outer `print()` adds a newline after each row.

### 8. **List Comprehensions**

Though not a traditional loop, list comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists using `for` loops.

```python
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)

```

**Explanation:**

- This is a compact form of a `for` loop that creates a list of squares of numbers from `0` to `4`.
- The `print(squares)` statement outputs the list `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]`.

These examples show the versatility of Python's `for` loops, allowing you to iterate over various types of sequences and perform operations efficiently.

## 2.1. Looping Using `range()`expanded:

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5a91443e-616b-43e4-b0b7-3012a6086b57/8bb0b082-f693-488c-8b6a-cc2d819c1d67/Untitled.png)

The `range()` function in Python is often used with a `for` loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers. The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which can be used to control the loop's iteration.

### **Using `range()` in a Loop**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to use a `range()` loop:

### **1. Basic `range()` Loop**

```python
# 1. Start a for loop to iterate over numbers from 0 to 4 (inclusive)
for i in range(5):
    # 2. Print the current value of `i`
    print(i)

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The `range(5)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `0` up to `4` (but not including `5`). The loop variable `i` takes on each value in this sequence.
- **2.** Inside the loop, `print(i)` outputs the current value of `i`.

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4

```

### **2. `range(start, stop)` Loop**

```python
# 1. Start a for loop to iterate over numbers from 2 to 5 (inclusive of 2, but exclusive of 6)
for i in range(2, 6):
    # 2. Print the current value of `i`
    print(i)

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The `range(2, 6)` function generates numbers starting from `2` up to `5` (but not including `6`). The loop variable `i` takes on each value in this sequence.
- **2.** Inside the loop, `print(i)` outputs the current value of `i`.

**Output:**

```
2
3
4
5

```

### **3. `range(start, stop, step)` Loop**

```python
# 1. Start a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 10, incrementing by 2 each time
for i in range(1, 11, 2):
    # 2. Print the current value of `i`
    print(i)

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The `range(1, 11, 2)` function generates numbers starting from `1` up to `10` (but not including `11`), incrementing by `2` each time. The loop variable `i` takes on each value in this sequence.
- **2.** Inside the loop, `print(i)` outputs the current value of `i`.

**Output:**

```
1
3
5
7
9

```

### **4. `range()` Loop in Reverse Order**

```python
# 1. Start a for loop to iterate over numbers from 5 down to 1 (inclusive of 5, exclusive of 0)
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    # 2. Print the current value of `i`
    print(i)

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The `range(5, 0, -1)` function generates numbers starting from `5` down to `1` (but not including `0`), decrementing by `1` each time. The loop variable `i` takes on each value in this sequence.
- **2.** Inside the loop, `print(i)` outputs the current value of `i`.

**Output:**

```
5
4
3
2
1

```

### **Summary of `range()` Parameters**

- **`range(stop)`**: Generates numbers from `0` to `stop - 1`.
- **`range(start, stop)`**: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop - 1`.
- **`range(start, stop, step)`**: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop - 1`, with increments of `step`.

The `range()` function is a powerful tool in Python loops, enabling precise control over the sequence of numbers the loop iterates over.

### **3. Writing a `while` Loop**

The `while` loop continues to execute as long as a condition remains `True`.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Start with the `while` keyword**.
2. **Write the condition** that must be true for the loop to continue.
3. **Indent the block of code** to be executed while the condition is true.

**Template:**

```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is True
    pass  # Replace this with your code

```

**Example: Counting Down**

```python
i = 5

while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1  # Decrease the value of i

```

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5a91443e-616b-43e4-b0b7-3012a6086b57/6a2e1028-5042-4e73-bcce-a915e504f203/Untitled.png)

In Python, `while` loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. There are various ways to use `while` loops depending on the conditions and logic you need. Below are the different types of `while` loops based on common patterns:

### 1. **Basic `while` Loop**

A basic `while` loop runs as long as the condition remains true.

```python
count = 0

# 1. Start a while loop that continues as long as count is less than 5
while count < 5:
    # 2. Print the current value of count
    print(count)
    # 3. Increment count by 1 to eventually break the loop
    count += 1

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The loop starts and checks if the condition (`count < 5`) is true.
- **2.** If true, the loop executes the block of code, printing the current value of `count`.
- **3.** `count` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, and the loop continues until `count` reaches 5.

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4

```

### 2. **`while` Loop with `else`**

An `else` block can be added to a `while` loop, which executes after the loop condition becomes false.

```python
count = 0

# 1. Start a while loop that continues as long as count is less than 3
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
else:
    # 2. Once the loop finishes, the else block executes
    print("Loop ended")

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The loop runs while `count < 3` is true.
- **2.** When the loop condition becomes false (`count` is no longer less than 3), the `else` block executes, printing "Loop ended."

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
Loop ended

```

### 3. **Infinite `while` Loop**

An infinite `while` loop runs indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of using a control statement like `break`.

```python
# 1. Start an infinite loop
while True:
    print("This loop will run forever.")
    break  # 2. Break out of the loop after the first iteration

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The loop condition `True` is always true, so the loop runs indefinitely.
- **2.** The `break` statement exits the loop after the first iteration.

**Output:**

```
This loop will run forever.

```

### 4. **`while` Loop with `break`**

The `break` statement is used to exit a `while` loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.

```python
count = 0

# 1. Start a while loop that continues as long as count is less than 10
while count < 10:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    # 2. Break the loop if count equals 5
    if count == 5:
        break

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The loop continues as long as `count < 10` is true.
- **2.** When `count` reaches 5, the `break` statement exits the loop immediately.

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4

```

### 5. **`while` Loop with `continue`**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

```python
count = 0

# 1. Start a while loop that continues as long as count is less than 5
while count < 5:
    count += 1
    # 2. If count equals 3, skip the rest of the loop and continue with the next iteration
    if count == 3:
        continue
    print(count)

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The loop continues as long as `count < 5` is true.
- **2.** When `count` equals 3, the `continue` statement skips the `print(count)` line for that iteration, and the loop moves to the next iteration.

**Output:**

```
1
2
4
5

```

### 6. **Nested `while` Loops**

You can place one `while` loop inside another to create nested loops, useful for iterating over multi-dimensional data or implementing more complex logic.

```python
i = 1

# 1. Outer loop
while i <= 3:
    j = 1
    # 2. Inner loop
    while j <= 2:
        print(f"i = {i}, j = {j}")
        j += 1
    i += 1

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The outer loop runs as long as `i <= 3` is true.
- **2.** The inner loop runs while `j <= 2` is true, nested inside the outer loop. This results in each iteration of the outer loop triggering a full cycle of the inner loop.

**Output:**

```
i = 1, j = 1
i = 1, j = 2
i = 2, j = 1
i = 2, j = 2
i = 3, j = 1
i = 3, j = 2

```

### 7. **Condition-Dependent `while` Loop**

A `while` loop that relies on more complex conditions or external inputs.

```python
password = ""

# 1. Keep asking for input until the correct password is entered
while password != "secret":
    password = input("Enter the password: ")
print("Access granted.")

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** The loop runs as long as the entered password is not equal to `"secret"`.
- **2.** Once the correct password is entered, the loop exits, and "Access granted" is printed.

---

These examples showcase how versatile `while` loops can be in Python, allowing you to create loops that continue based on conditions, handle infinite loops, and more.

### **4. Using Loop Control Statements**

Control statements modify the behavior of loops. The most common ones are `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.

**`break`: Exiting a Loop Early**

- **Use Case**: When you want to stop the loop before it naturally finishes.
- **Syntax**: Place `break` inside the loop at the point where you want to exit.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when i is 5
    print(i)

```

**`continue`: Skipping an Iteration**

- **Use Case**: When you want to skip the current iteration and continue with the next one.
- **Syntax**: Place `continue` inside the loop where you want to skip to the next iteration.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop body for this iteration
    print(i)

```

**`pass`: Doing Nothing**

- **Use Case**: When you need a placeholder for future code or want to intentionally do nothing.
- **Syntax**: Place `pass` where you want the loop to do nothing.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        pass  # Do nothing
    print(i)

```

### **5. Writing Nested Loops**

You can place one loop inside another loop to perform more complex iterations.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Write an outer loop**.
2. **Write an inner loop** inside the outer loop.
3. **Both loops will run, with the inner loop completing all its iterations** for each iteration of the outer loop.

**Template:**

```python
for outer_variable in outer_sequence:
    for inner_variable in inner_sequence:
        # Code to execute for each combination of outer and inner loop
        pass  # Replace this with your code

```

**Example: Multiplication Table**

```python
for i in range(1, 4):  # Outer loop
    for j in range(1, 4):  # Inner loop
        print(f"{i} * {j} = {i * j}")

```

### **6. Practical Examples**

### Examples

### **1. Iterating Over a String**

```python
# 1. Assign the string "Python" to the variable `word`
word = "Python"

# 2. Start a for loop to iterate over each character in the string `word`
for letter in word:
    # 3. Print the current character (letter) in the loop
    print(letter)

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** We initialize the variable `word` with the string `"Python"`.
- **2.** The `for` loop begins, and the loop variable `letter` takes on the value of each character in the string `word` one at a time.
- **3.** Inside the loop, the `print(letter)` statement outputs each character in `word` on a new line.

### **2. Calculating the Sum of Numbers**

```python
# 1. Create a list of numbers and assign it to the variable `numbers`
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# 2. Initialize a variable `total` to 0 to store the sum
total = 0

# 3. Start a for loop to iterate over each number in the list `numbers`
for number in numbers:
    # 4. Add the current number to `total` and update `total`
    total += number

# 5. Print the final value of `total` after the loop completes
print(f"Total sum: {total}")

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** We create a list `numbers` containing the integers `1` to `5`.
- **2.** We initialize the variable `total` to `0`, which will hold the sum of the numbers.
- **3.** The `for` loop begins, iterating through each number in the `numbers` list.
- **4.** Inside the loop, `total += number` adds the current number to `total`.
- **5.** After the loop finishes, `print(f"Total sum: {total}")` outputs the total sum of the numbers.

### **3. Finding the First Even Number**

```python
# 1. Create a list of numbers and assign it to the variable `numbers`
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9]

# 2. Start a for loop to iterate over each number in the list `numbers`
for number in numbers:
    # 3. Check if the current number is even using the modulo operator `%`
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # 4. If the number is even, print it as the first even number
        print(f"First even number: {number}")
        # 5. Exit the loop after finding the first even number
        break

```

**Explanation:**

- **1.** We create a list `numbers` containing the integers `1`, `3`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `9`.
- **2.** The `for` loop begins, iterating through each number in the `numbers` list.
- **3.** Inside the loop, the `if number % 2 == 0:` condition checks if the current number is even. The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the division. If it's `0`, the number is even.
- **4.** If the condition is true, the `print(f"First even number: {number}")` statement outputs the first even number found.
- **5.** The `break` statement exits the loop after printing the first even number, so the loop doesn't continue checking the remaining numbers.

These examples demonstrate the basic usage of loops in Python to iterate over sequences, calculate sums, and find specific elements.

### **7. Tips and Best Practices**

- **Indentation**: Ensure your loop code is correctly indented, as Python relies on indentation to define code blocks.
- **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Be careful with `while` loops to ensure the condition will eventually become `False`.
- **Use Descriptive Variable Names**: Name your loop variables meaningfully to improve code readability.

### **8. Testing and Debugging Loops**

- **Test with Small Data**: Before running loops on large datasets, test with smaller data to ensure correctness.
- **Use Print Statements**: Debug by printing variables inside the loop to track their values.

By following these steps, you can effectively use loops in Python to solve a wide range of problems.

Beside the iteration of lists we also have iteration of a range… were the range is basically the start of a number until where you want it to stop:

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5a91443e-616b-43e4-b0b7-3012a6086b57/fd35f5b7-4d27-41bc-8969-688c0f9d7a74/Untitled.png)

```python
for variable in range(start, stop, step):
    # Code to be executed for each value in the range
    # Indentation is crucial in Python

```

Explanation:

- **`for`**: Keyword indicating the start of the loop.
- **`variable`**: Variable name that represents the current value in the range during each iteration.
- **`in`**: Keyword used to link the variable with the range.
- **`range(start, stop, step)`**: Function that generates a sequence of numbers starting from **`start`** (inclusive) up to, but not including, **`stop`**, with a step size of **`step`**. The **`start`** and **`step`** parameters are optional, and the default values are **`0`** and **`1`** respectively.
- **Colon (`:`)**: Indicates the beginning of the indented block of code that will be executed for each iteration.
- **Code to be executed for each value in the range**: Block of code that runs for each value in the range.

Here's a simple example:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

```

Explanation:

- The **`range(1, 6)`** generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive).
- The loop iterates over these numbers, and the variable **`i`** takes each value in the sequence.
- The indented block **`print(i)`** is executed for each value of **`i`**, printing the current number.

Output:

```
Code output:
1
2
3
4
5

```

## While Loop

- The **`while`** loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- Syntax:

Example Code:

```python
# Example: Simple while loop to count from 1 to 5

# Initialize a counter
counter = 1

# While loop to count and print numbers from 1 to 5
while counter <= 5:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
```

The output of this program will be:

1
2
3
4
5

# writing your first while loop

health = 10

while health > 0:
print(health)
health -= 1     # forgetting this line will result in infinite loop
