# **Python Datetime Tutorial: Manipulate Times, Dates, and Time Spans**

## Python datetime Classes

Before jumping into writing code, it’s worth looking at the five main object classes that are used in the `datetime` module. Depending on what we’re trying to do, we’ll likely need to make use of one or more of these distinct classes:

- **datetime** – Allows us to manipulate times and dates together (month, day, year, hour, second, microsecond).
- **date** – Allows us to manipulate dates independent of time (month, day, year).
- **time** – Allows us to manipulate time independent of date (hour, minute, second, microsecond).
- **timedelta**— A *duration* of time used for manipulating dates and measuring.
- **tzinfo**— An abstract class for dealing with time zones.

### Creating Date Objects

First, let’s take a closer look at a `datetime` object.

Since `datetime` is both a module and a class within that module, we’ll start by importing the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module.

Then, we’ll print the current date and time to take a closer look at what’s contained in a `datetime` object. We can do this using `datetime`‘s `.now()` function. We’ll print our datetime object, and then also print its type using `type()` so we can take a closer look.

```python
# import datetime class from datetime module
from datetime import datetime

# get current date
datetime_object = datetime.now()
print(datetime_object)
print('Type :- ',type(datetime_object))
```

```python
2019-10-25 10:24:01.521881
Type :-  'datetime.datetime'
```

Certainly! Let's break down the provided Python code step by step:

```python
# import datetime class from datetime module
from datetime import datetime

```

1. **Import Statement:**
    - The code starts by importing the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module.
    - `from datetime import datetime` means we are specifically importing the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module.

```python
# get current date
datetime_object = datetime.now()

```

1. **Datetime Object Creation:**
    - The `datetime.now()` function is used to get the current date and time.
    - This datetime object is then assigned to the variable `datetime_object`.

```python
print(datetime_object)

```

1. **Print Current Datetime:**
    - The `print` statement is used to display the value of the `datetime_object`.
    - This will output the current date and time when the code is executed.

```python
print('Type :- ', type(datetime_object))

```

1. **Print Datetime Object Type:**
    - Another `print` statement is used to display the type of the `datetime_object`.
    - It prints the string 'Type :- ' followed by the type of `datetime_object` using `type(datetime_object)`.

In summary, this code imports the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module, creates a `datetime` object representing the current date and time, prints the value of this object, and then prints its type. When executed, it will output the current date and time along with the type of the `datetime_object`.

### Extract Year and Month from the Date

Now we’ve seen what makes up a `datetime` object, we can probably guess how `date` and `time` objects look, because we know that `date` objects are just like `datetime` without the time data, and `time` objects are just like `datetime` without the date data.

We can also anticipate some problems. For example, in most data sets, date and time information is stored in string format! Also, we may not *want* all of this date and time data — if we’re doing something like a monthly sales analysis, breaking things down by microsecond isn’t going to be very useful.

So now, let’s start digging into a common task in data science: extracting only the elements that we actually want from a string using `datetime`.

To do this, we need to do a few things.

### Handling Date and Time Strings with strptime() and strftime()

Thankfully, `datetime` includes two methods, `strptime()` and `strftime()`, for converting objects from strings to `datetime` objects and vice versa. `strptime()` can read strings with date and time information and convert them to `datetime` objects, and `strftime()` converts datetime objects back into strings.

Of course, `strptime()` isn’t magic — it can’t turn *any* string into a date and time, and it will need a little help from us to interpret what it’s seeing! But it’s capable of reading most conventional string formats for date and time data (see [the documentation for more details](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior)). Let’s give it a date string in YYYY-MM-DD format and see what it can do!

```python
# import datetime class from datetime module
from datetime import datetime

# define the string containing the date
my_string = '2019-10-31'

# Create date object in given time format yyyy-mm-dd
my_date = datetime.strptime(my_string, '%Y-%m-%d')

# Print the created date object
print(my_date)

# Print the type of the date object
print('Type: ', type(my_date))

print('Month: ', my_date.month) # To Get month from date
print('Year: ', my_date.year) # To Get month from year
```

Now, let's break it down:

1. **String Definition:**
    - `my_string = '2019-10-31'`: A string variable named `my_string` is defined, containing a date in the format 'yyyy-mm-dd'.
2. **Datetime Object Creation:**
    - `my_date = datetime.strptime(my_string, '%Y-%m-%d')`: The `strptime` method of the `datetime` class is used to create a datetime object (`my_date`) from the string `my_string`. The second argument `'%Y-%m-%d'` is a format specifier that matches the format of the string.
3. **Print the Created Date Object:**
    - `print(my_date)`: Displays the value of `my_date`, which is the datetime object representing the date '2019-10-31'.
4. **Print the Type of the Date Object:**
    - `print('Type: ', type(my_date))`: Displays the type of `my_date`, showing that it is a datetime object.
    - print('Month: ', my_date.month) : Prints the month extracted from the **`my_date`** object using the **`.month`** attribute.
    - print('Year: ', my_date.year) : Prints the year extracted from the **`my_date`** object using the **`.year`** attribute.

   ### Getting Day of the Month and Day of the Week from a Date

    Let’s do some more extraction, because that’s a really common task. This time, we’ll try to get the day of the month and the day of the week from `my_date`. Datetime will give us the day of the week as a number using its `.weekday()` function, but we can convert this to a text format (i.e. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday…) using the `calendar` module and a method called `day_name`.

    We’ll start by importing `calendar`, and then using `.day` and `.weekday()` on `my_date`. From there, we can get the day of the week in text format like so:

    ```python
    # import calendar module
    import calendar
    print('Day of Month:', my_date.day)
    
    # to get name of day(in number) from date
    print('Day of Week (number): ', my_date.weekday())
    
    # to get name of day from date
    print('Day of Week (name): ', calendar.day_name[my_date.weekday()])
    ```

    Let's break down the code step by step:

    1. **Import necessary modules:**

        ```python
        import calendar
        from datetime import datetime
        
        ```

        - `calendar`: A module that provides various calendar-related functions.
        - `datetime`: A module that supplies classes for working with dates and times.
    2. **Create a datetime object for a specific date:**

        ```python
        my_date = datetime(2024, 3, 4)  # Replace with your desired date
        
        ```

        - `datetime(2024, 3, 4)`: Creates a `datetime` object representing the date March 4, 2024.
    3. **Print the day of the month:**

        ```python
        print('Day of Month:', my_date.day)
        
        ```

        - `my_date.day`: Accesses the `day` attribute of the `datetime` object, which represents the day of the month.
    4. **Print the day of the week as a number:**

        ```python
        print('Day of Week (number): ', my_date.weekday())
        
        ```

        - `my_date.weekday()`: Invokes the `weekday()` method of the `datetime` object, which returns the day of the week as a number (Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6).
    5. **Print the day of the week as a name:**

        ```python
        print('Day of Week (name): ', calendar.day_name[my_date.weekday()])
        
        ```

        - `calendar.day_name[my_date.weekday()]`: Uses the `weekday()` value as an index to access the corresponding day name from the `calendar.day_name` list.

    The output of the code will be something like:

    ```python
    Day of Month: 4
    Day of Week (number):  0
    Day of Week (name):  Monday
    
    ```

    Adjust the `datetime` object (`my_date`) to the desired date for which you want to retrieve information.
