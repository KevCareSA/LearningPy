# HTTP status codes

HTTP status codes is a conversation between your browser and the site server. The server gives responses to the browser’s request in the form of a three-digit code known as HTTP status codes.

Categories of HTTP status codes are.

- Informational responses (100–199)
- Successful responses (200–299)
- Redirects (300–399)
- Client errors (400–499)
- Server errors (500–599)

## Informational Responses

The HTTP status codes are used to indicate that any specific HTTP request has successfully completed or not.

There are four Informational Responses those are **Continue**, **Switching Protocols**, **Processing**, and **Early**

All of them are described below:

- **100 Continue:** The HTTP 100 Continue Informational Response status code is used to inform the client that till now everything is OKAY with the request. If the work is done then the client will ignore it if it’s not done yet then the client will proceed with the other requests. The server needs to send a final response when the request has been completed. When the request contains the Expect header field that includes **100-continue** expectation, the 100 response indicates that the server waiting to receive the request payload body. The client does not need to send the request-header with the **100-continue** expectation. If it does not wish to send a request body. **Status:**

    ```python
    100 Continue
    ```

- **101 Switching Protocols:** The HTTP 101 Switching Protocol Informational Response status code is used to indicate the protocols that are going to switch for the client request which includes the upgrade request header for the protocols. This status code can be used with the WebSockets. **Status:Example:** Performing with the websockets.

    ```python
    101 Switching Protocols
    ```

    ```python
    HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    ```

- **102 Processing:** The 102 Processing Informational Response status code is used to indicate that the server received the request and working on the request but in response, there is nothing till now.
- **103 Early Hints:** The 103 Early Hints Informational Response status code is used with the link header to allow the User-Agent to reloading the resources when the server is preparing a response. So basically when the server is working on to prepare the response then, the 103 Early Hints forcefully reloading the resources so the server can have few times on preparing a response. **Status:**

    ```python
    103 Early Hints
    ```

## **Successful Responses**

The HTTP status codes are used to indicate that any specific HTTP request has successfully completed or not.

There are ten Successful Responses those are **OK**, **Created**, **Accepted**, **Non-Authoritative Information**, **No Content**, **Reset Content**, **Partial Content**, **Multi-Status**, and **Already Reported**. All of them are described below:

- **200 OK:** The HTTP 200 OK response meaning is that the request made by the client has been successful, but the meaning of the success depending on the four type of request made by the clients. The **GET** method fetch and transmitted the resources in the message body. The **HEAD** method is placed in the message body as a entity header. The **POST** method describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body, and the last **TRACE** method contains the request message as received by the server. **Status:**

    ```python
    200 OK
    ```

- **201 Created:** The 201 Created indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource. It means the origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 Created code if that is not possible then it will become 202 Accepted. Basically this HTTP status code indicates that a new resource has been created as a result of the successful completion of a request. **Status:**

    ```python
    201 Created
    ```

- **202 Accepted:** The 201 Accepted indicates that the request from the client has been received, but it does not means the server is working on it. Maybe that time the server is working on other requests, so the client has to wait until the turns of that accepted request come. Accepted means it will definitely proceed. **Status:**

    ```python
    202 Accepted
    ```

- **203 Non-Authoritative Information:** The 203 Non-Authoritative Information indicates that the request has been received and understood and the information sent back to the client as the response is from a third-party rather than from the original server. The 203 holds a similar value compared to 214, 214 has the advantage of being applicable to responses with any status code. **Status:**

    ```python
    203 Non-Authoritative Information
    ```

- **204 No Content:** The 204 No Content indicates that the server has successfully processed the request but needs to return any content or maybe there is no need to send back any data. This code is cacheable by default. Tag header is included in such a response. Best suited as a result of a PUT request which updates the content without changing the current content of the page visible to the client. If the page is gonna change it will become 200 OK. **Status:**

    ```python
    204 No Content
    ```

- **205 Reset Content:** The 205 Reset Content is send from the server to the client to request the client that reset the content from which the original document was sent. Like if client is sending the details in a form so need to refresh the UI. **Status:**

    ```python
    205 Reset Content
    ```

- **206 Partial Content:** The 206 Partial Content indicates that the server is sending only a part of the requested resource due to a range header sent by the client. There can two situations if the range is one the Content-Type will be the type of the document returned. If there are several ranges then Content-Type is set to multipart/byteranges and each fragment covers one range. **Status:**

    ```python
    206 Partial Content
    ```

- **207 Multi-Status:** A multi-status response conveys information about multiple resources where message body is followed by an XML message and contains separate response codes.
- **208 Already Reported:** Already Reported used inside of the <dav:propstat> and it response element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection.

## **Redirection Responses**

These status codes indicate that further action needs to be taken by the client to fulfill the request.

This request can have several possible responses:

- **300 Multiple Choice:** It is a link list. This request can have maximum five possible responses. The user can choose one of the links and go to the location. **Status:**

    ```
    300 Multiple Choice
    ```

- **301 Moved Permanently:** The **301 moved permanently** means that the requested resource has permanently been moved to a new URL. The new URL is given in the response. **Status:**

    ```
    301 Moved Permanently
    ```

- **302 Found:** The **302 Found** means that the requested resource has been moved temporarily to a new URL. The same URL should be used by visitors in a future request. **Status:**

    ```
    302 Found
    ```

- **303 See Other:** The requested resource can be found under an alternate URL. This is sent by the server to direct the visitor to another URL to get the requested page. **Status:**

    ```

    ```

- **306 Switch Proxy:** This response code is no longer in use. But, the code is reserved as it was used in the previous version. **Status:**

    306 Switch Proxy
    ```

- **307 Temporary Redirect:** The **307 temporary redirect** means that the requested resource has been moved temporarily to a new URL. It shares the same semantics as of 302 Found, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used. **Status:**

    ```
    307 Temporary Redirect
    ```
